        <h3> About AxJ Fitness</h3>
        <p>Getting in shape shouldn’t be a punishment. It’s an amazing and empowering lifestyle decision that anyone can make. I believe in finding the pleasurable side of fitness; and while there may be a sore muscle or two along the way, the benefits of fitness is worth the discomfort. I have developed my training regime by working with a variety of people, and always love adapting my program to new clients.</p></div>
